## Description
PymvDB is a Python library designed to create and manage a vector database for images.
it comes with the ability to use Hugging Face image feature extraction models as encoders.

running it with [google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) takes 0.41 seconds to 
encode an image on my machine (Ryzen 7 2700)

## Installation
You can install PymvDB using pip (coming soon):

```sh
pip install pymvdb
```

while waiting for me to publish it on pip, you can download and install PymvDB using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BBurgarella/PymvDB.git
cd PymvDB
pip install .
```

## Usage
TBD
